I'm @JohanRova.

I'm currently in a two year education to become a .NET Developer, about halfway done. It mainly focuses on C# and .NET Frameworks, but will also include databases as well as webdevelopment with HTML, CSS and JavaScript(including frameworks).

If you want to hire me, or collaborate, send me an email!
